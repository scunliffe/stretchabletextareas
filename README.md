Complete user-control over the size of the textarea (width/height) ensures that the user can get the exact size they need, regardless of what the developer thought/guessed they wanted.

* If you want to write a novel, feel free to stretch it tall and wide for greater visibility
* If sized three times larger than you need, you can shrink it to just the right size to see evertying on the screen in context
* Or maybe you're developing a screen and you just want to play with the size in real-time to best guess your default


There's really no downside to enabling stretching a textarea (unless your layout is severely constrained) - the only downside is that Internet Explorer doesn't support this feature for textareas - until now!

Introducing StretchableTextareas for Internet Explorer 8, 9, 10, 11, & Project Spartan.  This simple jQuery plugin will automatically "enable" stretchable textareas in IE.
