# StretchableTextareas
A jQuery plugin to enable stretchable textareas in Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.

Users of all? other desktop web browsers have long enjoyed the usability feature of stretchable textareas in their browsers.

![StretchableTextareas Example][1]

Complete user-control over the size of the textarea (width/height) ensures that the user can get the exact size they need, regardless of what the developer thought/guessed they wanted.

* If you want to write a novel, feel free to stretch it tall and wide for greater visibility
* If sized three times larger than you need, you can shrink it to just the right size to see evertying on the screen in context
* Or maybe you're developing a screen and you just want to play with the size in real-time to best guess your default


There's really no downside to enabling stretching a textarea (unless your layout is severely constrained) - the only downside is that Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge do not support this feature for textareas - until now!

Introducing StretchableTextareas for Internet Explorer 8, 9, 10, 11, & Microsoft Edge.  This simple jQuery plugin will automatically "enable" stretchable textareas in IE/Edge.

Note while Internet Explorer (all versions) and legacy Microsoft Edge (built on the Trident engine) are basically EOL now, I'm keeping this updated example here for reference.

## Release Notes
* Updated the sample page to use the latest jQuery version (will not work in IE 8) so that the GitHub dependabot will stop spamming me about old jQuery version vulnerabilities ;-)
